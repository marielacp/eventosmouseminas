            Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist 
            and United States Navy rear admiral.[1] One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a 
            pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea 
            of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming
             language still in use today.

            <p>Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she 
                was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career
                 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly 
                 Computer Corporation and was part of the development team that designed the UNIVAC I computer in 1944. It was at 
                 Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English
                  by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine 
                  code that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for the A-0 System 
                  programming language.[2][3][4][5]</p>
